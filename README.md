# FashionMNIST NN
a fashion MNIST  data NN model with 1 hidden layer

Simple 1 hidden layer NN  developed from scratch.

784 nodes per instance input layer size.

300 nodes hidden layer size.

the model trained on 55k train samples labeled from 0-9. 

MNIST data set 28X28 pictures already proccesed and convert to scale of 0-255.

tested on 5k test samples with 82.1% of accuracy.

feel free to use and adapt hyper parameters or methods.

instructions:
download python 3.6.
download numpy.

due to file size limitations the x_train set is divided to sub files.

in order to use the code properly you should merge those files.

linux: 
1. enter the terminal and cd to the files path.
2. use the cat command as follows : **cat train_xaa train_xab train_xac train_xad train_xae train_xaf > train_x**
3. put the files in the same path/directory.
4. run the .py file and get your "test_y" output file.
